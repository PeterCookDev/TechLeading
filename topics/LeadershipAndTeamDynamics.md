Takeaway: Listen to what you are hearing. Watch and wonder about other people. Know your enemies - try to understand people you have disputes with.

Takeaway: Your job is to adjust to what the team needs. Ensure Safety - people need to feel safe and trust each other. Faciliate the technical discussions. Teams need a clear goal and direction to move forward as a group. Ensure the team doesn't silo - rotate people around jobs, collaborate heavily. Demonstrate how you want the team to behave - but also allow experienced teams to set their own contract.
