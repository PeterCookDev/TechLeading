Takeaway: You must earn your teams trust. Don't let your team of direct reports get too big. Make people a priority. Prioritise spending time in 121s with your people. Avoid rescheduling or being late wherever possible. Help people address their problems with each other directly - mediate if needs be. Your success is the success of others.
