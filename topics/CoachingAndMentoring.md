Takeaway: Don't give people solutions - ask them to find the solution on their own. Ask them for 3 possible approaches they could take then discuss the solutions. Get the team to come up with guidelines. The team hone their skills and gain shared knowledge. You stop being a bottleneck. Give them a timebox and help them understand constraints like time to implement.
